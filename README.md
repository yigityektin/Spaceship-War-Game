# Spaceship-War-Game
It is a game you can fight with enemies in space with a spaceship.

I wrote a game using Python and Pygame. I spent 1.5 days. About the game: The player is controlling the spaceship and aliens in enemies comes to the player pixel by pixel. The player shoots at the enemies to kill them. If he kills the game creates another enemy. There is also a limit of the enemy so the game canâ€™t create infinite enemies. User can control the spaceship with direction keys. If the enemy and spaceship crash the game ends.
